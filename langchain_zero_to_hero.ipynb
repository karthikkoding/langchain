The rover has also discovered evidence of liquid water on Mars and has been able to gather data on the planet's rotation and wobbling. China's Zhurong rover, which landed on Mars in May 2022, has been in hibernation but is expected to wake up soon. NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars since 2012, continues to explore the Red Planet and has recently found a mysterious metallic object.
